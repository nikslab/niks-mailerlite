Notes on design:
<p>
1. The task is obviously limited in scope given its application (test of skill). There are several things that would be natural to add even to an existing task, but I will not, because then there would be more things to add to that, and then more things to add to that... and next thing you know I am your competitor 🙂
<p>
For example… subscriber to what? So a “list” table would sound natural. Ok, but then we need endpoints for that too. It’s a different, much bigger task. So I didn’t do it. Stuck to the task at hand.
<p>
2. On the front end you ask for pagination, which implies multiple results on the read, but your task says to write an endpoint which searches for a “subscriber” (one), probably by e-mail.
<p>
How would one even search to get multiple results on an e-mail address? I suppose parts of e-mail but who does that. Usually it would be something like different lists or even search by other fields like “name”. So I added a field "name".
<p>
3. All field validation is done on the front end. This is standard practice but also the API will be called a million times per minute. We don’t want the API checking whether the e-mail is proper a million times per minute. The only thing we do on the write is make sure the e-mail address is converted to all lowercase. Failing to do that (having records like “BOB@gmail.com” and “bob@gmail.com”) would really mess things up on search depending on how the collation of the database is done or would be have to be done MySQL on every query. That's wasteful.
<p>
4. Chose Vue.js front end because it requires the least resources and for a simple demo it can be included with CDN--does not require Node.js and npm, etc. In a real application, different choices might be made.
